# Random-EV-Demand-Generator
This repository includes details on how I generated random EV demand data for Sharjah, UAE, based on predicted UAE EV penetration rates and the publicly avaible ElaadNL EV demand data. The ElaadNL data is accessible on: https://platform.elaad.io/download-data/

The Jupyter notebook files in the repository should be run in the numeric order of the notebook file names.
